&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Childhood was over and I was in school  &lt;br&gt;
I need to read books and write exams  &lt;br&gt;
Teachers and parents made it painful for me.  &lt;br&gt;
I hate reading,  &lt;br&gt;
I wanted to quit reading but  &lt;br&gt;
the only solution was to get a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the job in IT and I have to read more technology books  &lt;br&gt;
than I read in my school &amp;amp; college  &lt;br&gt;
Initially, I enjoyed it but when I realized  &lt;br&gt;
these people are writing more books every day  &lt;br&gt;
than I can read in my whole life.  &lt;br&gt;
I hate reading  &lt;br&gt;
I wanted to quit software development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    &lt;/span&gt;        
    
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a city, every road in this city  &lt;br&gt;
Has potholes and it is causing  &lt;br&gt;
Lots of accidents, court case, and pain  &lt;br&gt;
among civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to fix this problem  &lt;br&gt;
Intellectuals are debating  &lt;br&gt;
that city needs to have  &lt;br&gt;
more hospitals, more emergency wards,  &lt;br&gt;
more doctors, more medicines  &lt;br&gt;
more nurses, more advocate,  &lt;br&gt;
more police force on the roads,  &lt;br&gt;
more jails, more human right activist, etc.  &lt;br&gt;
It means this entire economy is based on negative professions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A twelve years old boy in a deep mountain  &lt;br&gt;
quite engrossed in his play with crops, trees, mud, cattle, and fountain.  &lt;br&gt;
He had a mother and other siblings  &lt;br&gt;
His mother used to scold him and sometimes beat him for his mischief.  &lt;br&gt;
Boy was very angry and questioned why my mother is unfair to me.  &lt;br&gt;
One day he asked his mother. Are you my real mother?  &lt;br&gt;
Why do you beat me and not my other siblings?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h1 class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;An Example Of Web Of Problems 
    &lt;div id=&#34;an-example-of-web-of-problems&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;span
        class=&#34;absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;        
    
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever can wrong, will go wrong. Today I wanted to file my Annual GST return and this is what happened to me. I don’t know whether this much ever happened to any of you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Wanted to file my GST Annual Return (10 am) -&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
2. Need to pull Billing Details from Excel File -&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
3. Excel License Expired today -&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
4. Wanted to Renew License but for payment this time I wanted GST Bill with my GST details-&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
5. No option of entering my GST number on Microsoft website-&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
6. Did research, no outcome -&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
7. Call Microsoft, Pathetic Help -&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
8. Finally Come to Know for Home Edition GST Bill not available -&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
9. In the meantime found since last 3 years MS every year increasing cost of this software around 1000/year (INR 4200 to 5200 to 6300 this year) so to reduce the cost by adjusting GST I Wanted to Purchase Software through Business Account-&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
10. Went on Microsoft site to create office license under my company name (I have a google private domain name for that)-&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
11. It asked me to enter TXT or MX record in the domain to prove that I am the owner of the site-&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
12. Existing domain is a private domain so TXT or MX records cannot be updated -&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
13. Existing &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:pmohead@drrxxx.in&#34;&gt;pmohead@drrxxx.in&lt;/a&gt; is customer’s account so no use for me as of today -&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
14. Tried my another domain, but encountered a problem that emails are bouncing from there-&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
15. Researched and come to know that it is because of Cloudflare -&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
16. Figured out how Cloudflare works and why I installed this-&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
17. Now, to make email working I called the hosting company of this domain-&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
18. They told me to make MX or TXT record entry in Cloudflare DNS and use that Cloudflare provided DNS-&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
19. Figured out where DNS entry should be made (it should be done at domain provider’s site), in my case my domain is taken from godaddy so on godaddy site -&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
20. By default GoDaddy has its own DNS entry corresponding to my domain -&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
21. My content is hosted on Hostgator therefore I should enter HostGator DNS on GoDaddy site (it was learning for me) -&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
22. If I want Cloudflare should work then DNS records provided by Cloudflare should be entered -&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
23. I tried, now emails are not bouncing but not getting delivered as well -&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
24. I research this issue further and come to know that this is a common problem that Cloudflare and email compatibility issue exist and lot of struggle to make it work -&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
25. Disabled my Cloudflare services for my domain on Cloudflare site -&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
26. Made GoDaddy DNS entry as default -&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
27. Now my website site stopped working-&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
28. Come to know that changes will be effective in 24-48 hours, so wait-&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
29. But then realized that DNS entry should be of Hostgator because that is the place where content is hosted -&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
30. So changed the DNS on hostgator, now domain is working -&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
31. Still I don’t have any new domain which I can use to purchase Microsoft 365 office business license-&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
32. Used my third domain RXXX-&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
33. Earlier I was not using this because I didn’t want to confuse my licensing with too many unrelated domains but now I have no solution -&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
34. Created new Microsoft office 365 account with RXXX domain-&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
35. Now wanted to purchase the license but now it says the cost of the business license itself equal to the cost which I was paying for Office 365 Home Edition + GST. And GST is extra. so the whole exercise is futile-&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
36. Started looking for an alternative of office 365 -&amp;gt; Found libre 6.2.4 &amp;amp; Polaris Office 2017 -&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
37. Download and tried but only Polaris is a little bit near to Office 365 -&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
38. Finally took the decision this year I will not use Office 365 and manage with Polaris, free license, or if required professional license. If this does not serve my purpose and a need arises during my data science work then only I will purchase-&amp;gt;  &lt;br&gt;
39. Finally open GST billing data in Polaris software&lt;/p&gt;</description>
