&lt;p&gt;You cannot understand anything without your questions. Books, interviews, newspapers, and podcasts are boring if you are not interested in the subject and don&amp;rsquo;t have any questions. Whether you know the answer or get the answer or understand the answer or dont&amp;rsquo;s understand that all is secondary. To explore something, you must have some questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government is about power. If you are interested in knowing how these powers come into existence, how they work, and control your life, then you must explore them.
