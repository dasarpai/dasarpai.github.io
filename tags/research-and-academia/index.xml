&lt;p&gt;I have been in software development between 1993 to 2009. Some of these years were in senior leadership roles in delivery management, project management, CMMI, ISO, ISMS, PMO, etc. In 2010 I moved into project management training and consulting. In 2018, I was considering going back to technology but this time I wanted to pick up a completely new stack of technology. I decided I would move into Data Science and AI. I knew AI as much as any typical software development person in senior management knew about this. It means I was highly confident that I could pick this up quickly. On top of that lots of content is available on the internet, many YouTube channels, and many courses are available. I thought it should be a cakewalk for me. I started learning this technology in my own way in my committed free time. Within 5-6 months after lots of study I started realizing this was the way to get the knowledge but it could not help me get confident to solve the problem. The more I learned, the more I felt that I did not know how much I needed to learn or how far I needed to go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the realm of document typesetting and preparation, LaTeX stands as a timeless giant, revered by professionals, researchers, students, and publishers alike. With its unmatched typographic quality, precision, and versatility, LaTeX empowers users to create documents that transcend the boundaries of conventional word processing. In this article, I am listing major capabilities that make LaTeX the tool of choice for those who demand perfection in their documents, ready to learn some coding and don&amp;rsquo;t want to pay for all this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h1 class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;How to Conduct Literature Review? 
    &lt;div id=&#34;how-to-conduct-literature-review&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;span
        class=&#34;absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100&#34;&gt;
        &lt;a class=&#34;group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700&#34;
            style=&#34;text-decoration-line: none !important;&#34; href=&#34;#how-to-conduct-literature-review&#34; aria-label=&#34;Anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;        
    
&lt;/h1&gt;


&lt;h2 class=&#34;relative group&#34;&gt;Introduction 
    &lt;div id=&#34;introduction&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;span
        class=&#34;absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100&#34;&gt;
        &lt;a class=&#34;group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700&#34;
            style=&#34;text-decoration-line: none !important;&#34; href=&#34;#introduction&#34; aria-label=&#34;Anchor&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;        
    
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literature Review (LR) or Literature Survey (LS) is a process that helps you to browse the libraries, literature, articles, books, conference proceedings, etc. The objective of this process is to study the work of other researchers in the field and around the topic you are interested in. This is one of the heaviest work in any research work. If you are not on track or this process is taking unusually longer time, then it means you don&amp;rsquo;t have any guiding process or best practices in place. As per my experience during my MS in Data Science and Ph.D./DBA in AI-Natural Language Processing, I am writing my thoughts in this article. I am sure it will help you, especially if you are entering in the field of research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
